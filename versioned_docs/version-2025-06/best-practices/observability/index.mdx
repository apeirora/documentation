This page describes the approach towards **observability** in the Apeiro Reference Architecture.

Observability in software and infrastructure is essential for operating a complex cloud environment. High-quality observability will enable teams to:

- Detect and troubleshoot issues quickly,
- Maintain performance and reliability,
- Make data-driven improvements.

## Core Signals

The three key signals of observability are **metrics**, **logs**, and **traces**, each providing unique insights contributing to a comprehensive view of a system's health.

### Metrics
Metrics are numerical data points reporting on a system health over time. Examples of metrics can be CPU usage, memory usage, request latency.

### Logs
Logs are detailed records of system or application events. These can be in various formats like structured/unstructured, single-/multi-line or written to files/streamed. Logs provide text-based data for post-incident analysis and crucial for auditing, troubleshooting or improving a system.

### Traces
Traces follow a request's journey through the system, capturing latency and failures across microservices. Traces are key for understanding dependencies, diagnosing bottlenecks and debugging the source code with real system data.

## Tools
Common Open Source Tools to capture these signals are:
- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)** is a tool for collecting and querying metrics. It uses a time-series database optimized for real-time data, making it ideal for gathering system health data, enabling alerting, and visualizing trends.
- **[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org)** provides a scalable platform for log indexing, search, and analysis of logs. Enabling teams to sift through large volumes of logs to identify issues and understand system behaviour over time.
- **[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io)** is a tool for distributed tracing, providing a detailed view of request paths and performance across services.
- **[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io)** was developed as a framework for instrumenting applications and infrastructures to collect metrics, logs and traces. It defines a standard for unifying the processing of all three types of signals. In addition to providing an API and SDKs for multiple programming languages, **OpenTelemetry** also simplifies the integration with backend systems such as Prometheus, OpenSearch and Jaeger.

## Observability using Greenhouse

The ApeiroRA project <Term>Greenhouse</Term> provides a suite of <Term>Greenhouse Plugins</Term>, including pre-packaged configurations for monitoring and logging tools. These *Plugins* are designed to simplify the setup and configuration of observability components. It enables users to quickly deploy monitoring and logging solutions to their Greenhouse clusters.

The following *Plugins* are currently available:

- [Kube-Monitoring](https://cloudoperators.github.io/greenhouse/docs/reference/catalog/kube-monitoring): installs *[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)* to collect custom and Kubernetes specific metrics with standard Kubernetes alerting enabled. 
- [Thanos](https://cloudoperators.github.io/greenhouse/docs/reference/catalog/thanos): installs *[Thanos](https://thanos.io)* to enable long term metric retention and unified metric accessibility.
- [Perses](https://cloudoperators.github.io/greenhouse/docs/reference/catalog/perses): installs *[Perses](https://perses.dev)* an open cloud native dashboard tool for Prometheus and other data sources
- [Alerts](https://cloudoperators.github.io/greenhouse/docs/reference/catalog/alerts): installs *[Prometheus AlertManager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/)* and *[Supernova](https://github.com/sapcc/supernova)* to manage and visualize alerts sent by Prometheus.
- [Logs](https://cloudoperators.github.io/greenhouse/docs/reference/catalog/logs): installs *[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io)* in the form of *[OpenTelemetryCollectors](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector)* to collect metrics and logs from applications and forward them to backends like Prometheus and OpenSearch.
- [Audit-Logs](https://cloudoperators.github.io/greenhouse/docs/reference/catalog/audit-logs): installs *[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io)* in the form of *[OpenTelemetryCollectors](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector)* to collect *audit-relevant* logs from applications and forward them to backends like Prometheus and OpenSearch.

## Audit Logging

Audit logging describes the capability of capturing audit-trail relevant events of a system to meet compliance requirements. Such events may originate from infrastructure components up to the workloads that run on top. It is a capability that is particularly relevant for providers of enterprise software.

Unlike regular application logs, audit logs are usually subject to long retention periods and software providers must guarantee their completeness (i.e. guarantee of delivery).

Examples of audit logs include:
- failed login attempts
- permission changes (e.g. of a service account or application user)
- accessing sensitive information
- modification of data

ApeiroRA aims to bring audit logging to OpenTelemetry. While many capabilities required to process audit logs already exist in OTel, standardized semantic conventions for audit logs and delivery guarantees are missing.

Therefore, ApeiroRA is working together with the OpenTelemetry community on the following deliverables:
- semantic convention for audit logs
- extension of OTel APIs/SDKs for audit logging purposes
- extension of OTel Collector for audit logging purposes
