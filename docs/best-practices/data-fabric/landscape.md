Since [ORD](https://open-resource-discovery.github.io/specification/spec-v1) defines three distinct roles for system landscape components (referred to as <Term>services</Term> in Apeiro terminology), the diagram below illustrates a potential scenario and the corresponding data flow between logical components within the system landscape.

*Prerequisite:
The metadata model must be onboarded into UMS (Unified Metadata Service).*


## Application Resources Describe Themselves Through ORD
1. All exposed resources (e.g., APIs, Events) must provide metadata definitions, including the primary business object they operate on and any referenced business objects.
2. Each service must expose its ORD document(s) and ORD configuration through a well-known configuration endpoint, enabling discovery of metadata definitions.

## Metadata Aggregation via UMS

UMS serves as the central ORD aggregator. It retrieves metadata from services, stores it in the metadata repository according to the onboarded metadata model, and exposes it via the metadata discovery components of UMS.

## Metadata Visualization and Consumption

The landscape resource viewer acts as an ORD consumer, providing a visual representation of the aggregated metadata in the form of a metadata graph. Additional consumption use cases can also be supported.

The target system landscape can be represented as follows:
