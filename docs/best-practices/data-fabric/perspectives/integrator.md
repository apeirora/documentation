Role: Utilizes standardized metadata and service definitions to streamline cross-system integration and ensure data consistency.


A deep understanding of system capabilities and their exposed resources is essential for an integrator, whose primary responsibilities include enabling system interoperability, orchestrating workflows, mapping and transforming data, and managing APIs and event-driven communication.

The ability to visualize relationships between resources at the business object level significantly accelerates these tasks and reduces implementation complexity. A key tool in this process is the **Landscape Resource Viewer**, which renders a metadata graph of services and resources based on information aggregated by the <Term>Unified Metadata Service</Term>.
