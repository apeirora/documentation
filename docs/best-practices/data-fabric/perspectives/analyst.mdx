Role: Gains access to enriched, discoverable, and well-documented data assets, enabling faster and more accurate analysis.


One of the key prerequisites for effective analytics is the consistency of aggregated data, underpinned by a clear understanding of its sources. The **Landscape Resource Viewer** streamlines the process of achieving this target state by providing a comprehensive view of metadata relationships.

Similar to the integrator's use case, analysts benefit from a visualized metadata graph that reveals the interconnections between service-provided resources, their deployment context, and associated business objects. This enables faster root-cause analysis, data lineage tracing, and improved trust in the analytics output.
