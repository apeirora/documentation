Role: Focuses on on exposing and leveraging exposed metadata and APIs for building and extending applications efficiently.

Data Fabric provides not only a conceptual and architectural framework but also a suite of developer tools aimed at minimizing effort and streamlining implementation.

* **ORD Plugin** enables the generation of ORD documents for SAP CAP or Java based application. When the ORD plugin is added, the developed application gains a single entry point, which allows to discover and gather machine-readable information or metadata about the application. This information can be used to construct a static metadata catalog or to perform a detailed runtime inspection of actual system instances / system landscapes.

* **API Metadata Validator** is a tool for ensuring compliance and correctness of API documentation formats like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GraphQL, and ORD. It is useful for developers and teams to maintain high-quality API documentation and prevent errors in API integration.

* **ORD Crawler** is a tool that retrieves and verifies metadata from the ORD endpoint.

* [**ORD Provider server**](https://github.com/open-resource-discovery/provider-server) exposes static metadata via an HTTP endpoint using the Open Resource Discovery (ORD) protocol.
This mechanism enables the exposure of service-related metadata without altering the runtime behavior or implementation of the service itself.
The exposed metadata can be discovered and consumed by other services and aggregators, (e.g., Unified Metadata Service).
