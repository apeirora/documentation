title: Service Supplier

Role: Publishes services with aligned metadata, ensuring discoverability, traceability, and easy consumption by others.

As outlines in the sections [Services and Service Management](../../services/index.md) and [Platform Mesh: Service Supplier Perspective](../../platform-mesh/perspectives/service-supplier-perspective.md), a service in its most general form is a solution or active entity, which offers some API to its consumer. To make a service available, the supplier must register a service provider, which manages one or more services, in a service marketplace. The registration should include all necessary information for potential consumers, including API definitions. <Term>Open Resource Discovery</Term> facilitates consistent interface modeling across distributed systems, enabling standardized service description, discoverability, and streamlined integration within complex architectures.
