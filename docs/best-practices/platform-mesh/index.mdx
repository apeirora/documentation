**The high-level goal of the Apeiro Reference Architecture is to enable development and operation of applications and services** across public clouds, private clouds, and the edge - the <Term>cloud-edge continuum</Term>.
The use cases for these applications and services should be diverse and unrestricted, catering to end-users, other applications and services, IoT scenarios, and beyond.

The **ApeiroRA Platform Mesh** defines an environment that allows **<Term>service providers</Term> to offer services of any kind** and
**<Term>service consumers</Term> to discover those services, order <Term>capabilities</Term>, and control their lifecycle**.

The Apeiro Reference Architecture defines and implements the "<Term>Platform Mesh</Term>" that enables developers to select and utilize the needed and preferred services from various <Term>service marketplaces</Term>.
It does not make any assumptions about these services or the marketplaces, nor does it mandate the use of any specific services.
**Instead, it offers a mesh and the essential contracts that allows <Term>service providers</Term> to offer their services freely and enables <Term>service consumers</Term> to discover, order, and use these services.**

This framework aims to **transcend the traditional layered approach of strictly separating IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS in past infrastructures.**
Both higher-level and lower-level services are provided and managed through the same mechanism.

The reference architecture includes several common, but optional services. For a comprehensive list of these projects, visit the [Apeiro Reference Architecture website](https://apeirora.eu/content/projects/).
For example, ApeiroRA offers a Kubernetes environment through the <Project>Gardener</Project> project, but its use is not mandatory for applications. Other Kubernetes providers can also offer their services within the mesh.
This flexibility gives [developers](./perspectives/developer-perspective.mdx) more choices and helps prevent lock-in to a particular service supplier.
