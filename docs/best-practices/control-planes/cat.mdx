title: Controller Archetypes
---

This chapter explains the different types of controller archetypes.

The Kubernetes architecture is **API centric** and not API driven. The business logic runs outside the API server, in loosely coupled [controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) which bi-directionally map the virtual representation of <Term>digital twins</Term> to the real-world.  
We identify **three archetypes** for controllers and will explain them using Kubernetes native controllers `Kubelet`, `Scheduler`, `ReplicaSet`, `Deployment`, and their respective resource types or kinds.

## Actuators
    
Actuators are controllers which map real-world capabilities into the virtual-world (with digital twins). They bring capabilities into the realm of the Kubernetes API and explain the vast expansion of the community and ecosystem beyond containerized workloads only. [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/), [ExternalDNS](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/latest/), and `Kubelet` are examples of the actuator archetype.

The `Kubelet` controller is a fundamental component of Kubernetes. It acts as the node agent on each worker node. Each `Kubelet` first registers its node in the `Nodes` space and then watches for `Pods` that are assigned to it, essentially sharding the `Pods` space.

## Aspect or Attribute Controllers

Aspect or attribute controllers operate in the virtual-world, on existing digital twins. Their core business logic function is to map a desired aspect by enriching (calculating) attributes of digital twins which are covered/managed by other controllers.  
Besides `Scheduler`, for example, policy controllers such as [Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/) or [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) operate in this archetype category.

The `Scheduler` controller is a pivotal default component in the Kubernetes control plane, responsible for the [assigning of pods to nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/). It reads available `Node` digital twin objects and keeps a watch on all unscheduled `Pod` objects. The *binding* process to compute a suitable node can be [configured](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/).  
Ultimately, the `Scheduler` adjusts the `Pod:spec:nodeName` attribute of prior unscheduled `Pods` with its node assignment decision. This controller archetype obtains all information from the digital twins and only operates on digital twins.

## Logical Object Controllers

Logical object controllers operate in the virtual-world only, but they introduce new logical types. Their business logic function is to create and manage useful abstractions. All custom controllers or operators (for example on [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io)) fall into this archetype.  
They introduce new digital twin abstractions and often productize their offering using other abstractions, which at the end of the chain, typically spawn Kubernetes `Pods` with their workload. 

The `ReplicaSet` and `Deployment` controller are prime example of useful abstractions for the orchestration of containers. `ReplicaSet` [introduces a new digital twin type](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) which creates and manages `Pod` objects with the intent to ensure that a stable set of replicas are running at any given time. And `Deployment` [introduces a new type](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) by instrumenting `ReplicaSet` to offer declarative lifecycle management (via rolling updates, rollback, and scaling).
