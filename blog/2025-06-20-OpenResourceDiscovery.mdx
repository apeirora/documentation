## Open Resource Discovery (ORD): Driving Industry Wide Benefits Through Standardization

In complex enterprise environments, knowing which digital services, events, and data products are available — and how to integrate with them — is a well-known challenge. As businesses evolve, the ability to discover, understand, and consume digital offerings becomes increasingly critical.
[Open Resource Discovery (ORD)](https://open-resource-discovery.github.io/specification/), now an independent open standard under the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) (via the [NeoNephos Foundation](https://neonephos.org)), was designed to solve this challenge. It provides a standard, automated way for industries to describe and publish services, events, and data products directly from their source systems, making it an ideal foundation for digital collaboration and integration across platforms.

## Why ORD Matters for Industries
Modern enterprises operate across fragmented landscapes — diverse platforms, microservices, APIs, events, and data products. Without a common way to describe and discover these offerings, teams waste time searching, aligning, and re-validating information.

ORD creates a decentralized and open method for making these resources discoverable and actionable across ecosystems. Its benefits for industries include:

**Standardization:** Enables seamless discovery and integration across internal and external landscapes.

**Automation:** Enables tools and platforms to read service metadata and configure connections automatically.

**Trust:** Provides services, events, and data descriptions directly from the source, making them authoritative and up to date.

**Interoperability:** Supports common protocols and metadata formats, making it applicable across industries and platforms.

## ORD in Action: SAP’s Journey
At SAP, ORD has been pivotal in addressing these very challenges across its own expansive ecosystem. It has enabled:
- **Business Accelerator Hub / API Catalog:** By allowing SAP to publish service and API offerings in a standardized way, making it easy for customers and partners to discover and consume them.

- **BTP Service Landscape:** By supporting runtime introspection across SAP Business Technology Platform, making services, APIs, and events discoverable within complex landscapes.

- **Data Products in Business Data Fabric (BDC):** By providing a common approach to describing data products, making them more accessible and actionable for analytics, AI, and application development.

- **Automation and AI:** When metadata is published and connected via ORD it can help to aid automation and AI. Since many AI protocols are just APIs of specialized protocols, they can be described, catalogued and discovered via ORD, too. 

- **Knowledge Graphs:** By making service and data's metadata discoverable, ORD contributes to building connected knowledge graphs, providing a holistic view of enterprise resources.


## The Road Ahead for Industries
With ORD now a fully independent open standard under the Linux Foundation, its potential goes far beyond any one company. Its open and collaborative nature positions it to become a cornerstone for integration, discovery, and automation across industries — from manufacturing and finance, to logistics, automotive, and beyond.

By adopting ORD, organizations can:

✅ Break down silos across their platforms and ecosystems.

✅ Accelerate the onboarding of services, APIs, and data offerings.

✅ Enable higher levels of automation and AI driven integration.

✅ Build a more resilient and future proof enterprise architecture.
